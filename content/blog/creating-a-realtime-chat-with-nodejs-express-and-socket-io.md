title: Creating a Realtime Chat with NodeJs, Express and Socket.io

A few years ago I was tasked with building a mobile app (which happened to be my first). Part of this app's requirements was to have private chat rooms for each group of users. Users could be added to the group via invitation by the group creator.

The tech stack I knew how to work with best at this point in time was the MEAN stack, so I looked for web technology-based solutions for creating mobile apps and stumbled upon the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com).

At this point in time, AngularJs was the A in MEAN stack and so Ionic relied on this as well. In order to stay within the Javascript & NodeJs ecosystem, I researched how to create a chat app and inevitably stumbled across Socket.IO.
