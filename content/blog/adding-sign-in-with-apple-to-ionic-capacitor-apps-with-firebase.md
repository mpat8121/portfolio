### Setup the Firebase Project

If you are new to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) then you'll need to sign up (it's free!), otherwise head over to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and hit the Add project button.

Give your project a name in step 1, if you want analytics, leave it enabled in step 2 and hit create.

Once it has finished spinning up, hit the iOS button to add an iOS app to the project. Apple sign in is only really useful for users with Apple devices, so iOS only.
