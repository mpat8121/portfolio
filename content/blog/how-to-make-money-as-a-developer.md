### How to Make Money as a Developer

If you're an individual who can code, with any level of experience, you are lucky. Your skills are in demand given that we live in a digital world and people and businesses need your skills to help them succeed.

There's a lot of content out there on the internet telling you that you can make passive income as a developer. This is... up to interpretation. It is possible to have created products that generate ongoing income for you without requiring large amounts of ongoing input, but the real truth is that none of the possible ways to make money as a developer are work free. Some require less ongoing work than others, but they all require your time and energy. If you want to outsource the ongoing work, this is an option, but your profit margins will need to be sufficient to make it financially viable.

The below ways to make money as a developer will assist you in finding the way(s) that suits your desired lifestyle, work-life balance and time availability.

### Full-time Employment

This is the most secure way to make money as a developer. A full-time job should give you the security of getting paid consistently throughout the year. 

If you find a good job, you will be paid quite well and should be able to spend your days working with interesting people. Working in a team and on larger projects/products will also most likely give you a really good education on setting up processes and various management styles to get products built.

The downsides of a full-time job are you have to work the hours the company or your boss expects or is required to get the work done. This can mean unpaid overtime. It's also possible that the nature of the work can be boring or repetitive. There's only so many times you can write code to automate sending email notifications before you start losing interest. Ultimately, there is also only so many promotions you can get before you hit a ceiling. This can either mean you need to move into management roles or job hop to try to find the best lead/senior role available. 

### Freelancing

Freelancing can be lucrative no matter where you live, as well as giving you the flexibility to work from anywhere. That being said, it is a hard grind, particularly to get started. 

Finding clients, convincing them you're the developer for them, completing the work and then getting paid are all ongoing hustles. Once you've completed a number of projects and created a good reputation for yourself, the work will start coming to you and you'll be able to command premium rates. 

Most of the freelancers I know hustled hard initially until they found a few clients that had ongoing work requirements that they then contracted to outside of the standard freelancing platforms. From my experience, this is the most common outcome. 

The flexibility and variety of work offered via freelancing are very attractive to some people if they can get themselves set up and with a good reputation.

Sites, where you can sign up as a freelancer to offer your skills, include:

### Run your own company

This is one option that I personally have implemented. I run [Interapptive](https://www.interapptive.com.au) with a business partner. We started out offering services but found more satisfaction and better balance in building our [own apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7306544510458352015) and [SaaS products](https://www.defectwise.com.au).

The main reason for me to decide to have my own company is that the earning potential is essentially infinite. It is only limited by my own desire to work and successes. 

It is really hard work though.

For me, having a company also allows me to split my personal finances from the company. I don't have to use my own money to pay for the resources the company requires. All invoices and expenses go through the company. As the owner of the company, I am able to invest personal funds if required.

In order to run your own company, you need to have something to sell. As a developer, this can either be through services or a product. Further in this list, there are ideas for both of these. You also have to be willing to do the advertising and marketing and all administration work that comes with being the owner of a company.

It is also easier as a company to hire freelancers, contractors or employees if and when required.

### Build indie apps

Building indie apps is complementary to the above. Most likely, you'll publish your apps under a company or trading name, but behind the scenes, it is not necessary to actually have a company.

Apps can be incredibly lucrative, either through in-app advertising and purchases or through upfront purchases. 

Building an app can be a huge amount of work depending on the complexity of the app. It may also require a good understanding of the full-stack as you may need to build databases, APIs and the front-end of the app.

You're also likely going to need to perform all support duties for your users, which can become overwhelming if you create a popular app.

### Blogging

You're on my blog right now. Hopefully, it is providing some value to you. I didn't, and don't continue to, spend hours writing and formatting content and sourcing images just for fun. It makes some money too.

Blogging can be a good money maker, but it isn't going to happen quickly. You'll need to produce a lot of content, and consistently add more. It'll need to be good content that also conforms to Google's SEO requirements to make sure you appear in the right search results.

The main ways to make money from your blog are to include advertisements, include affiliate links that give you a percentage of any sales via the links, self-promotion of any other items/products you have to sell, and if you create a reputation for yourself, others may pay you to write guest posts on their blogs. 

Things like ads require you to have large amounts of traffic to your blog. For example, Google Adsense will pay somewhere in the range of $3-$6 for every 1,000 views of an advertisement displayed on your blog. so, in order to make $600 per month from your blog, you need at least 100,000 views. This is more than achievable but requires a lot of well-targeted content that is SEO'd and well written.
