### How to Make Money as a Developer

If you're an individual who can code, with any level of experience, you are lucky. Your skills are in demand given that we live in a digital world and people and businesses need your skills to help them succeed.

There's a lot of content out there on the internet telling you that you can make passive income as a developer. This is... up to interpretation. It is possible to have created products that generate ongoing income for you without requiring large amounts of ongoing input, but the real truth is that none of the possible ways to make money as a developer are work free. Some require less ongoing work than others, but they all require your time and energy. If you want to outsource the ongoing work, this is an option, but your profit margins will need to be sufficient to make it financially viable.

Many of the below ways to make money are complimentary and will give you the best results if you do connect and cross-promote your content to make the most of them.

The below ways to make money as a developer will assist you in finding the way(s) that suits your desired lifestyle, work-life balance, skillsets and time availability.

### Full-time Employment

This is the most secure way to make money as a developer. A full-time job should give you the security of getting paid consistently throughout the year. 

If you find a good job, you will be paid quite well and should be able to spend your days working with interesting people. Working in a team and on larger projects/products will also most likely give you a really good education on setting up processes and various management styles to get products built.

The downsides of a full-time job are you have to work the hours the company or your boss expects or is required to get the work done. This can mean unpaid overtime. It's also possible that the nature of the work can be boring or repetitive. There's only so many times you can write code to automate sending email notifications before you start losing interest. Ultimately, there is also only so many promotions you can get before you hit a ceiling. This can either mean you need to move into management roles or job hop to try to find the best lead/senior role available. 

### Freelancing

Freelancing can be lucrative no matter where you live, as well as giving you the flexibility to work from anywhere. That being said, it is a hard grind, particularly to get started. 

Finding clients, convincing them you're the developer for them, completing the work and then getting paid are all ongoing hustles. Once you've completed a number of projects and created a good reputation for yourself, the work will start coming to you and you'll be able to command premium rates. 

Most of the freelancers I know hustled hard initially until they found a few clients that had ongoing work requirements that they then contracted to outside of the standard freelancing platforms. From my experience, this is the most common outcome. 

The flexibility and variety of work offered via freelancing are very attractive to some people if they can get themselves set up and with a good reputation.

Sites, where you can sign up as a freelancer to offer your skills, include:

* [Freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com)
* [upwork.com](https://upwork.com)
* [fiverr.com ](https://fiverr.com)
* [toptal.com](https://toptal.com)
* [guru.com](https://guru.com)
* [peopleperhour.com](https://peopleperhour.com)

### Run your own company

This is one option that I personally have implemented. I run [Interapptive](https://www.interapptive.com.au) with a business partner. We started out offering services but found more satisfaction and better balance in building our [own apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7306544510458352015) and [SaaS products](https://www.defectwise.com.au).

The main reason for me to decide to have my own company is that the earning potential is essentially infinite. It is only limited by my own desire to work and how successful the things I make are.

It is really hard work though.

For me, having a company also allows me to split my personal finances from the company. I don't have to use my own money to pay for the resources the company requires. All invoices and expenses go through the company. As the owner of the company, I am able to invest personal funds if required.

In order to run your own company, you need to have something to sell. As a developer, this can either be through services or a product. Further in this list, there are ideas for both of these. You also have to be willing to do the advertising, marketing and all administration work that comes with being the owner of a company.

It is also easier as a company to hire freelancers, contractors or employees if and when required.

### Build indie apps

Building indie apps is complementary to the above. Most likely, you'll publish your apps under a company or trading name, but behind the scenes, it is not necessary to actually have a company.

Apps can be incredibly lucrative, either through in-app advertising and purchases or through upfront purchases. 

Building an app can be a huge amount of work depending on the complexity of the app. It may also require a good understanding of the full-stack as you may need to build databases, APIs and the front-end of the app.

You're also likely going to need to perform all support duties for your users, which can become overwhelming if you create a popular app.

### Blogging

You're on my blog right now. Hopefully, it is providing some value to you. I didn't, and don't continue to, spend hours writing and formatting content and sourcing images just for fun. It makes some money too.

Blogging can be a good money maker, but it isn't going to happen quickly. You'll need to produce a lot of content, and consistently add more. It'll need to be good content that also conforms to Google's SEO requirements to make sure you appear in the right search results.

The main ways to make money from your blog are to include advertisements, include affiliate links that give you a percentage of any sales via the links, self-promotion of any other items/products you have to sell, and if you create a reputation for yourself, others may pay you to write guest posts on their blogs. 

Things like ads require you to have large amounts of traffic to your blog. For example, Google Adsense will pay somewhere in the range of $3-$6 for every 1,000 views of an advertisement displayed on your blog. so, in order to make $600 per month from your blog, you need at least 100,000 views per month. This is more than achievable but requires a lot of well-targeted content that is SEO'd and well written. In short, you will need hundreds of posts. Some will bring more traffic (and revenue) than others, but unfortunately, there is no certain way of knowing which posts will perform.

For instance, [API Versioning with NodeJs and Express](https://www.mickpatterson.com.au/blog/api-versioning-with-nodejs-and-express/) is my most heavily viewed post. There is no data from Google search trends, on my tech Twitter feeds or anywhere else I know of that indicated that this would be a topic that people were looking for specifically.

### Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing and blogging tend to be run in parallel, so if you're wanting to pursue affiliate marketing, you are probably going to need a blog. 

Affiliate marketing is quite simple if you can get enough eyeballs on your blog or wherever you are posting your affiliate links.

An affiliate link is a URL link to a product or service with a unique identifier added to the end. The unique identifier allows the provider of the product or service to know that you were the source of the visitor to their site. If the visitor makes a purchase or signs up for the service, you receive a payment for sending the person to the site in the first place. 

Some of the bigger affiliate marketing providers have fully-fledged programs you can sign up for to send users to multiple products (such as [Amazon](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com.au/)). Others only offer a single product or service and so you only need to create an account and get the link for the single item. 

These sorts of links for products are particularly useful if you blog about a specific technology or niche that has specific products. Your readers will be interested in the products just by already having found their way to your blog.

Some of the bigger ticket items offer big payouts if you send someone to their site and they make the purchase required. Others run on percentages rather than specified amounts (Amazon pays up to 12% of the product purchase price for example).

If you have other sources for an audience (social media for example) you can promote the affiliate links there. I would preface this with caution though as social media followers can find this to be spammy. Email newsletters can be a great way to promote affiliate products that match the topic of the newsletter to an already engaged audience.

### Sponsorships

A sponsorship essentially entails a business approaching you as a blogger to write one or more articles about their product offering. This can be a specific retail product or a service or a piece of software. As part of this agreement, the business will pay you either a set amount per post or an ongoing percentage of any sales that come from your blog posts (essentially the same as affiliate marketing). 

Sponsorships will work best if you already have a big audience either through blog traffic or a YouTube channel where the product can really be showcased. You'll also need to have a good reputation otherwise businesses won't approach you for their products.

### Guest blog posting

Once you've built a blog, created lots of good content and have a good audience, people in the blogging community of your niche will start to take notice. 

Guest posting is a good way to contribute to the community for the benefit of both yourself and the person you provide a post for. If you're well known and have your name on somebody else's blog, they'll get more traffic (win!) and you'll get more referral traffic from that post.

If you're lucky, the blog you get to post on will be bigger and more popular than yours at the time of writing/posting so you'll gain a lot of exposure.

Conversely, if you're the bigger name of the two, you can negotiate a fee with your counterpart for the post you write and post on their blog.  

### Create and Sell Code Templates

As you're reading the post, I'm assuming you're a developer or technology-based individual which most likely means you can code at least somewhat proficiently.

Selling your code as templates is a good way to create an ongoing income stream. 

The premise is relatively simple - you code up a template product (website, mobile app) and sell it online. 

Standing out in a crowded market is going to be your biggest challenge with this income stream. Again, having a pre-existing audience is going to greatly assist you in getting this off the ground and pushed out to other potential customers.

There are a number of platforms where you can list your templates (all of which will take a cut of each sale). Some of these are:

\- [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)\
- [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/)\
- [Codester](https://www.codester.com/)

Each of these platforms have rules regarding the quality of the templates and other items you must adhere to before they will list your product. 

An additional option is to configure your website/blog to allow the purchase/digital download itself. This is the best way to ensure you receive 100% of the purchase price, but you lose the benefits of having a pre-established marketplace.

### Create and Sell e-books

Are you an expert on a particular topic? Instead of breaking that down into 100's of blog posts, you can write it all down into an e-book. It's a lot easier now to self-publish the book or like above, just sell it on your own website. 

An e-book is a lot of work initially as you need to get everything you know about the topic written down in a sensible, structured way to make the total book coherent and it needs to be reasonably substantial in content and length to make it worth the purchase price for the buyer. However, once it is written and published, an e-book is a very good source of ongoing income with a little bit of marketing to get the e-book in front of potential buyers. 

### Create and Sell e-learning courses

There are great pre-existing platforms for distributing e-learning courses with low barriers to creating an account to upload your courses (assuming they meet the quality requirements of the platform). 

Similar to the e-book, e-learning courses are a great way to make ongoing income from a single product if you are a subject matter expert and can create engaging video/learning content.

The existing platforms will take a percentage of each sale, but a platform like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) will get you in front of millions of potential students. Udemy even provides courses themselves to help content creators create courses for their platform.

The tech industry/coding space is very competitive for e-learning, but the demand is also huge, so if you can create great content and market it well, this can be a very profitable income source.

### Run a Youtube Channel

A YouTube channel is a slow burn income source, similar to blogging. It will take lots of content over a sustained period of time before you start seeing any real income being generated.

Creating your own channel and putting up videos is simple enough, but you need to get 1000's of subscribers before YouTube allows you to monetise your channel, and even then, the income you can generate is always predicated by the number of views your video (ads) gets. 

This is why you need to build a huge audience over a long time and continually feed that audience with new content. The channels with huge subscriber bases make pretty good money so it is worth the time and effort in the long run.
