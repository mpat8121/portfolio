title: How to Set the Timezone of an Azure Function App
description: By default, the timezone of an Azure Function app is UTC/GMT +0 or
  Greenwich Mean Time. This is great if that is your timezone or the timezone
  you want your application functions to run in, but for most of us, we need to
  either adjust all our schedules to fit that timezone or we need to change the
  timezone.
