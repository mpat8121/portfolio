## What is Bun?

B﻿un is a new Javascript runtime that focuses on simplicity, performance and developer experience. It has been built with the lessons from NodeJs in mind to minimise some of the common pitfalls of a Javascript runtime.\
B﻿un has been built to minimise and abstract away a lot of the complexities from NodeJs to allow developers to focus on clean, maintainable, performant code.

## Getting Started

* I﻿nstall Bun for your OS as per the official Bun [instructions](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
* C﻿reate a folder for your Bun project code files to live. 
* I﻿n a terminal for the new folder run `bun init` to set up the Bun project
* C﻿reate an app.ts file in the folder

## C﻿reating the Bun Application

O﻿pen the app.ts file in your code editor of choice and add the following code:

```typescript
const server = Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response("Welcome to Bun!");
  },
});

console.log(`Listening on ${server.url}`);

```

I﻿f you are familiar with the Express framework, this should look very familiar.

T﻿his code snippet creates the bun app, sets up a basic response for the server, configures a port and starts the server.

## R﻿unning the Server

B﻿ack in your terminal with the project folder open, run `bun app.ts`

I﻿n a browser, you can now navigate to `http://localhost:3000` which will present you with the text 'Welcome to Bun!'

## C﻿onclusion

A﻿s shown above, the Bun framework provides a simple and effective way to create an HTTP server or API. This allows you to focus on writing clean, maintainable and performant code.
