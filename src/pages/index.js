        <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
        <p>
          Who am I?
        </p>
        <p>I'm a fullstack dev who has been working for the same small IT shop in Sydney, Australia for more than 10 years...<br/>
        I also run <a href="https://www.interapptive.com.au" target="_blank">Interapptive</a> on the side for funsies.</p>
        <p>My tech stack is mostly Node.Js, C#, Angular, Ionic with a little bit of Java and Swift thrown in for Capacitor plugin development. SQL Server, MySQL and MongoDB are my data stores of choice. 
          I also use Azure for all my DevOps needs.</p>
        <p>My work with InterApptive focusses on mobile apps, with our current project being <a href="https://defectwise.com.au" target="_blank">DefectWise</a></p>
        <p>This blog is short snippets of utility functions I use often, small tips I've found whilst building stuff, along with some case studies of my projects.</p>
        <Link to="/blog/">
          <Button marginTop="35px">Go to Blog</Button>
        </Link>
