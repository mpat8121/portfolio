        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p>I'm a self-taught fullstack dev who has been working for a small IT shop 
          in Sydney, Australia for more than 10 years...<br />
          I also run <a href="https://www.interapptive.com.au" target="_blank">Interapptive</a> on the side for funsies.</p>
        <p>Originally, I completed a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering. And then proceeded to
          not work a single day using the skills I spent 4 years at university acquiring. A couple of years
          spent doing CAD drafting work before moving into low level business analytics.
        </p>
        <p>The tech stack I work with is mostly Node.Js, C#, Angular, Ionic with a 
          little bit of Java and Swift thrown in for Capacitor plugin development. 
          SQL Server, MySQL and MongoDB are my data stores of choice.
          I also use Microsoft Azure for all my DevOps needs.</p>
        <p>My work with InterApptive focusses on mobile apps, with our current project 
          being <a href="https://defectwise.com.au" target="_blank">DefectWise</a></p>
        <p>I write short snippets of common code that gets used a lot, 
          small tips I've found whilst building stuff, 
          along with some case studies of my projects and a bit about how I got here.</p>
