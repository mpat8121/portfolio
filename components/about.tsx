            I hold a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, and from there I started my working life doing CAD drafting and business
            analytics for a few major Australian companies. Over time my responsibilites shifted to building business process management
            applications using Angular, and a couple of years later I published my very first cross-platform mobile app.

          <p className="about-p">
            The tech stack I work with evolves constantly, but I&apos;m most familiar with Node.Js, C#, Angular, Ionic
            with a little bit of Java and Swift thrown in for Capacitor plugin
            development. Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and MongoDB are my data stores of
            choice. I also use Microsoft Azure for all my hosting and DevOps needs.

            In this blog I want to share short snippets of common code that gets used a lot, small
            but crucial tips that I wish I learned sooner, I will also write up some case studies
            about my projects and my own professional development that may help others on their journey.
